# Jakarta Chatbot Web Services (JAX-CS)

JAX-CS is a [Java (Jakarta) EE](https://jakarta.ee/) specification specifically developed to implement [chatbots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot) within enterprise applications. Our main objective is to provide an API based on the core concept of speech acts, enabling developers to design conversational interactions and utilize all the features of Jakarta EE.

It is important to note that **our goal is not to provide an API for creating autonomous artificial intelligence that can learn and chat with users**. Instead, we aim to focus on implementing business requirements using testable best practices. With JAX-CS, developers can effectively integrate chatbot functionality into their enterprise applications to enhance user experiences and streamline communication processes.

Our API is designed to facilitate the development of chatbot-driven applications by leveraging the powerful features and frameworks of Jakarta EE. By adhering to industry standards and best practices, JAX-CS ensures the seamless integration of chatbot functionality into enterprise systems.
